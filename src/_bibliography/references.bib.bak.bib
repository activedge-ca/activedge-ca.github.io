 Title = {Dominant Resource Fairness: Fair Allocation of Multiple
Resource Types},
 Year = {2011},
 Abstract = {We consider the problem of fair resource allocation in a
system containing different resource types, where each user may have
different demands for each resource. To address this problem, we
propose Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), a generalization of max-min
fairness to multiple resource types. We show that DRF, unlike other
possible policies, satisfies several highly desirable properties.
First, DRF incentivizes users to share resources, by ensuring that no
user is better off if resources are equally partitioned among them.
Second, DRF is strategy-proof, as a user cannot increase her
allocation by lying about her requirements. Third, DRF is envyfree, as
no user would want to trade her allocation with that of another user.
Finally, DRF allocations are Pareto efficient, as it is not possible
to improve the allocation of a user without decreasing the allocation
of another user. We have implemented DRF in the Mesos cluster resource
manager, and show that it leads to better throughput and fairness than
the slot-based fair sharing schemes in current cluster schedulers.},

 abstract = {
Today's networks are maintained by "masters of complexity": network admins who have accumulated the wisdom to troubleshoot complex problems, despite a limiting toolset.  This position paper advocates a more structured troubleshooting approach that leverages architectural layering in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs).  In all networks, high-level intent (policy) must correctly map to low-level forwarding behavior (hardware configuration).  In SDNs, intent is explicitly expressed, forwarding semantics are explicitly defined, and each architectural layer fully specifies the behavior of the network.  Building on these observations, we show how recently-developed troubleshooting tools fit into a coherent workflow that detects mistranslations between layers to precisely localize sources of errant control logic.   Our goals are  to explain the overall picture, show how the pieces fit together to enable a systematic workflow, and highlight the questions that remain. Once this workflow is realized, network admins can formally verify that their network is operating correctly, automatically troubleshoot bugs, and systematically track down their root cause -- freeing admins to fix problems, rather than diagnose their symptoms.

    Abstract = {   Middleboxes, such as caches, firewalls, and
intrusion detection systems, form a vital part of network
infrastructure today.
    Administrators deploy middleboxes in diverse scenarios from
enterprise networks, to datacenters, to access networks.
    However, middleboxes are universally deployed under what we call
the `unilateral model', where middleboxes are deployed and configured
by administrators alone, for the benefit of hosts in a single domain
alone.

    In this thesis, we present two new deployment models for
middleboxes which offer new capabilities for middlebox usage as well
as new business models for middlebox deployment.
    Netcalls is an extension to the Internet architecture that allows
end host applications to invoke and configure middleboxes in any
network their traffic traverses; for example, we present a web server
that invokes inter-domain DDoS defense when it detects that it is
under attack.
    APLOMB is a system that allows enterprise networks (as well as
individual end hosts) to tunnel their traffic to and from a cloud
service that applies middlebox processing to their traffic, avoiding
the costly and management-intensive burden of administering
middleboxes in a local network.
    Netcalls and APLOMB allow ISPs and cloud providers (respectively)
to monetize their deployment of middleboxes by offering them as a
service to third-party clients; all the while presenting new
capabilities, in the case of netcalls by enabling application
interaction and in the case of APLOMB by providing better scalability
and easier management.

    We discuss both of these proposals and their benefits in detail;
we then discuss challenges and opportunities towards their deployment
and adoption.}

Ripcord enables researchers to build and evaluate new network features and topologies, using only commercially available hardware and open-source software. The Ripcord demo will show three examples of custom network functions, operating together, on top of a 160-node cluster. The first is a routing engine that isolates classes of traffic. The second is a dynamic network manager than adjusts links and switch power states to reduce energy. The third is a statistics aggregator that supports network health monitoring and automatic alerts. The demo will be interactive, with a visualization of live parameters for each link and switch, such as bandwidth, drops, and power status, as well a control panel to modify the traffic load. We feel that an interactive demo is the best way to introduce the research community to Ripcord and get their feedback.},

abstract={Cloud computing environments impose new challenges on
access control techniques due to multi-tenancy, the growing
scale and dynamicity of hosts within the cloud infrastructure,
and the increasing diversity of cloud network architectures.
The majority of existing access control techniques were originally
designed for enterprise environments that do not share
these challenges and, as such, are poorly suited for cloud
environments. In this paper, we argue that it is both sufﬁcient
and advantageous to implement access control only within
the hypervisors at the end-hosts. We thus propose CloudPolice, a
system that implements a hypervisor-based access
control mechanism. We argue that, not only can CloudPolice
support more sophisticated access control policies, it can do
so in a manner that is simpler, more scalable and more robust
than existing network-based techniques.},

    Datacenters have traditionally been architected as a collection
    of servers wherein each server aggregates a fixed
    amount of computing, memory, storage, and communication
    resources. In this paper, we advocate an alternative
    construction in which the resources within a server
    are disaggregated and the datacenter is instead architected
    as a collection of standalone resources.
    Disaggregation brings greater modularity to datacenter
    infrastructure, allowing operators to optimize their
    deployments for improved efficiency and performance.
    However, the key enabling or blocking factor for disaggregation
    will be the network since communication that
    was previously contained within a single server now traverses
    the datacenter fabric. This paper thus explores the
    question of whether we can build networks that enable
    disaggregation at datacenter scales.

    We present MegaPipe, a new API for efficient, scalable network I/O for 
    message-oriented workloads. The design of MegaPipe centers around the 
    abstraction of a channel—a per-core, bidirectional pipe between the kernel 
    and user space, used to exchange both I/O requests and event notifications. 
    On top of the channel abstraction, we introduce three key concepts of 
    MegaPipe: partitioning, lightweight socket (lwsocket), and batching.

    We implement MegaPipe in Linux and adapt memcached and nginx. 
    Our results show that, by embracing a clean-slate design approach, 
    MegaPipe is able to exploit new opportunities for improved performance 
    and ease of programmability. In microbenchmarks on an 8-core server with 
    64 B messages, MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29\% (for long 
    connections) and 582\% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the 
    performance of a modified version of memcached between 15\% and 320\%. 
    For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the 
    throughput of nginx by 75\%.
