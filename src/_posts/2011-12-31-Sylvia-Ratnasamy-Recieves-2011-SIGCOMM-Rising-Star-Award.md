Congratulations to [Sylvia](http://cs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia)!

> Each year, ACM SIGCOMM presents a "Rising Star" Award, 
> recognizing a young researcher - an individual no older 
> than 35 - who has made outstanding research contributions 
> to the field of communication networks during this early 
> part of his or her career. Depth, impact, and novelty of 
> the researcher's contributions will be key criteria upon 
> which the Rising Star award committee evaluate the nominees. 
> Also of particular interest are strong research contributions 
> made independently from the nominee's PhD advisor.

> The award to Sylvia Ratnasamy is in recognition of 
> outstanding research contributions, early in her career, 
> in content addressable networks, peer-to-peer and overlay 
> networks, and the realization of practical software routers.
